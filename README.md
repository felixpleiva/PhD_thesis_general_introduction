# Figure TPC of my PhD thesis

This repository contains code and data needed to generate the Figure 1.1A of my PhD thesis. The R code was created by Daniel Padfili (https://github.com/padpadpadpad) which use the "nls.multstart" and "rTPC" packages. To fit the thermal performance curve, I used the dataset of Mesas et al 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f4qrfj6vm) archived in Dryad and associated to the manuscript "Experimental evolution on heat tolerance and thermal performance curves under contrasting thermal selection in Drosophila subobscura", DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13777, by Andrés Mesas, Angélica Jaramillo, Luis E. Castañeda: the paper and the dataset are properly cited in my thesis. The figure "Figure 1.1A" is used in my thesis for illustrative purposes only.
